####Project Overview:
Project 1: Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree

The goal of this project was to build a portfolio website. I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and tasked with replicating that design in HTML and CSS. Customizing the images to personalize the page was encouraged. The final product is responsive and displays nicely on both mobile and desktop devices.

####File Structure:

*In the project root directory, the index.html file is simply a minified version of index_pretty.html

src: working files 
dist: production ready minified files and compressed images
